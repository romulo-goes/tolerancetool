Automata class & methods:
Used to represent finite-state automata, by means of a directed
graph object (from the igraph library) with labelled transitions.

Implemented here is the abstract base class _Automata.

Use DFA, NFA or PFA classes instead.

Provides access to many useful methods in discrete event systems,
e.g. parallel & product compositions or observer construction.

In general, these operations can be performed as follows:
>>> # For automata A , B:
>>> A_par_B = d.composition.parallel(A, B)
>>> obs_A = d.composition.observer(A)

Automata can be constructed by 'fsm' filetypes, providing easy
interface with DESUMA.
Alternatively, Automata can be created starting from an underlying
igraph Graph object.

The Automata structure is a directed graph with labelled transitions,
implemented as an igraph Graph object (member var '_graph').
Vertex names and edge labels can be accessed via the igraph Graph
EdgeSeq and VertSeq methods, accessed for an Automata G as follows:
>>> vert_seq = G.vs()
>>> edge_seq = G.es()
Note that the vs() and es() methods for the Automata class are directly bound to
the vs() and es() methods for the igraph Graph class.
vs() and es() have dict-like behavior for accessing attributes, which are used here
to store edge labels and vertex names, e.g:
>>> vert_name_list = G.vs["name"]
>>> edge_label_list = G.es["label"]
And to access specific entries by value or index:
>>> vert_index_7 = G.vs["name"][7]
>>> edge_name_a = G.es(label_eq="a") # if multiple edges labelled 'a', returns first by index
In many cases, information relevant to vertices & edges are stored in attributes. For example,
in PFA, probabilities of a transition occuring are stored in the "prob" attribute, e.g:
>>> prob_trans_a = G.es(label_eq="a")["prob"]

Vertices and Edges can be named/labelled after their creation by accessing the
"name"/"label" attribute in the VertexSeq/EdgeSeq dict:
>>> E.vs["name"] = ['A','B','C','D','E']
Note that the this process cannot be used to update individual entries.
For example, the following code will NOT change the name of vertex 'E':

>>> G.vs["name"][4] = 'F' # WILL NOT MODIFY THE VERTEX NAME

Instead, the `update_attributes()` method must be used to modify specific edge or vertex
attributes. These are igraph Graph Edge and Vertex methods. For details on these methods,
see the igraph Edge and Vertex class documentations.

>>> d = {"name" : 'F'}
>>> G.vs[4].update_attributes(d) # Name of vertex 4 is now 'F'
>>> G.es[0].update_attributes({"label" : 'b'}) # Change edge 0 label from 'a' to 'b'

More details on using the vs() and es() methods can be found in the igraph documentation.
For simply using the Automata class, further functionality than described here might not be
required. Implementing new functionality might however require the use of certain specific
igraph functions or methods. Having these bindings also means that many times passing an Automata
to a function (implemented here) expecting an igraph Graph will still function normally.
Useful in cases like product and parallel compositions (product_comp() and parallel_comp(),
but might cause some unintended problems?

Class Members:
Euc: set object of uncontrollable events.
Euo: set object of unobservable events.

X_crit: set of critical states, stored as names of states (not indices)

type: what 'type' of Automata
es: binding to igraph Graph 'edgeSeq' object, e.g.:
    >>> edgeSeqObj = automata_A.es()
    is equivalent to:
    >>> edgeSeqObj = automata_A._graph.es()
vs: binding to igraph Graph 'vertSeq' object, e.g.:
    >>> vertSeqObj = automata_A.vs()
    is equivalent to:
    >>> vertSeqObj = automata_A._graph.vs()

_graph: underlying igraph Graph instance storing the Automata structure. Contains the
    original EdgeSeq and VertSeq objects bound by the es() and vs() functions here.
    Usage of DESops should never require directly modifying the igraph Graph member.
    However, implementing new methods might require interfacing with igraph classes
    and functions.


    Further details of how the igraph library is used are included in the implementation
    files.
